\section{Period 1}

\subsection{Design}
What are all subjects I want to work on/learn this period?

\begin{itemize}
  \item Flat Design
  \item Soft shadows, layers and floating elements
  \item Minimalist Navigation
  \item Gradients 2.0
  \item Asymmetrical Design
\end{itemize}

How am I going to apply \& practice them?
\begin{itemize}
  \item JS Assignments
  \item PHP Assignments
  \item Frontend Assignments
\end{itemize}

The idea here is to take each JS \& PHP assignment I've already finished, and redesign them.
I'll make a design \& prototype in XD, and then I'll bring it into practice by coding it into 
the assignment using HTML, CSS \& JS.
