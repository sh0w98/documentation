\subsection{Frontend}
This part of the stack is meant to be as simple as possible. I'm just using standard JavaScript and CSS
as not to add more complexity to the application. Pug will be my templating engine of choice, since I already
know it's syntax and I like it quite a lot. I will organize my CSS, since it can otherwise get real messy really quickly; I'll use SMACSS to do that.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pug
  \item Vanilla JS
  \item Vanilla CSS w/ SMACSS
\end{itemize}
