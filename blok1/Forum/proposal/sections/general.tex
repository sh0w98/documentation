\subsection{General}
These packages are useful for general tooling tasks.
Webpack will be used to bundle normal JavaScript into ESNext compatible code
so I can use all the new features the languages has to offer.
Prettier and ESLint will be used to lint and format all JavaScript code.
Dotenv will be used to store configuration in environment variables.

\begin{itemize}

  \item dotenv
