\section{Project Timeline}

\subsection{Week 1}
The first week will comprise of purely design and protoyping.
The goal here is to have a full prototype including moodboard and everything else,
in review by the end of the week.

\subsection{Week 2}
The second week will be all about setting up the development environment and starting the development of the app.
This includes setting up version control, create the application architecture and folder structure, setting up the tooling
chain (Webpack, ESLint, Prettier, etc.).
I took a full week to setup tooling since webpack can sometimes be a real pain,
but if it ends up taking less time, I'll start working on tasks from the next week.

\subsection{Week 3}
The third week I'll start building the back-end of the application.
At this point, I want to focus on the front-end as little as possible, so I'll be
using a program like Postman to test the routes without frontend.
This is where all the CRUD funcionality will be created, as well as the
authentication process.

\subsection{Week 4}
The last week will be about creating the front-end; converting the design
created in the first week into a visually pleasing UX/UI.
