\subsection{Backend}
This part of the stack is used for the back-end of the application:
namely the API and the redering of templates.
Express.js will be used as a lightweight web framework with an MVC-like structure;
I haven't yet decided what exact structure I'll use, but it will be akin to MVC.
MySQL will be the database I'll be using to store all the data handled in the application.
I'll use sequelize as an ORM to interface with MySQL.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Express.js 
  \item MySQL through sequelize
\end{itemize}
