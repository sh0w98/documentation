\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project will be to build a forum app. It will implement CRUD
functionality with posts, threads and users. There will be and admin page where
users can sign up with a username and a password. When a user is authenticated,
he or she can change the content, otherwise the content can only be viewed.
CRUD will mean the ability to create, read, update and delete threads
(containing comments) and comments themselves. These components will also hold meta-data:
threads can be pinned, comments upvoted and downvoted, etc.
A user will only be able to change content
he or she created. The whole project will consist of two parts: design and
development. First I'll create a moodboard and a full prototype, then I'll
implement it into the actual application.
