  \item{Typography representation (what fonts are you going to use and for what headings, etc.)}
  \item{Icons (some samples of the style of icons you'll use, with icon pack named if used etc)}
  \item{Examples of images that represent the visual style you're going for}
  \item{Colorscheme with purpose assigned to each color (primary, secondary, accent, etc)}
\end{itemize}
